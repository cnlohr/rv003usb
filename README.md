# Using USB on the CH32V003

Ever wanted a 10 cent USB low-speed capable processor? Well, look no further. RV003USB allows you to, in firmware, connect a 10 cent RISC-V to a computer with USB. It is fundamentally just a pin-change interrupt routine that runs in assembly, and some C code to handle higher level functionality.

### It's small!

The bootloader version of the tool can create a HID device, enumerate and allow execution of code on-device in 1,920 bytes of code. Basic HID setups are approximately 2kB, like the Joystick demo.

### It's simple!

The core assembly code is very basic, having both an [interrupt](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/blob/master/rv003usb/rv003usb.S#L43) and [code to send](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/blob/master/rv003usb/rv003usb.S#L547). Additionally only around [250 lines of C](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/blob/master/rv003usb/rv003usb.c) code to facilitate the rest of the USB protocol.

### It's adaptable!

The [core assembly](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/blob/master/rv003usb/rv003usb.S) code is standardized, and there is also [a c file](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/blob/master/rv003usb/rv003usb.c) code, to handle different functionality with hid feature requests, control setup events, interrupt endpoints (send and receive) are all done in.

It shows both how to be a normal USB device, as well as how to write programs to run on your PC that can talk to your USB device.

### It requires very little hardware!

![Example Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/master/doc/schematic.png)

 * `U1` is a CH32V003
 * `J1` is a USB type C connector.
 * `R1` 1.5k 5% is required under all configurations, though it may connect D- to DPU or VCC if the intent is for the part to always be on-bus.
 * `U2`, `C1`, `C2` are used to run the CH32V003 at 3.3V.  For USB it should not be run beyond 3.6V.
 * `R2`, `R3` 5.1k resistors are only needed if using a type C connector and you want the host to provide 5V power.

It even supports the SOIC-8 - see this thread: https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/issues/25#issuecomment-1779130408

Optionally 33 or 47 ohm resistors may be placed in-series with D+ and D- to the port to reduce noise and help protect the chip.

### It's configurable

The Pins (Port and GPIO number) used for USB are configured in `usb_config.h`.

~~~C
#define USB_PORT D // [A,C,D] GPIO Port to use
#define USB_DP 3   // [0-4] GPIO Number for USB D+ Pin
#define USB_DM 4   // [0-4] GPIO Number for USB D- Pin
#define USB_DPU 5  // [0-7] GPIO for feeding the 1.5k Pull-Up on USB D- Pin; Comment out if not used / tied to 3V3!
~~~

All configured pins need to be on the same GPIO port.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only GPIOs 0-4 can be used for USB D+/D- due to limits of the [c.andi](https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/html/rvc.html#c-andi) instruction which can only hold a 5 bit value. 
> You **cannot use** PC5-PC7 and PD5-PD7 for D+/D-!

A 1,5k pull-up on D- is used to signal the presence of a USB low-speed device on the bus. `USB_DPU` is designed to control this pull-up, but this is optional. You have three options here:

1. Use `USB_DPU` to let RV003USB controll the GPIO. You're limited to using the same port as for D+/D-.
2. Comment out `USB_DPU` and tie the pull-up to 3V3. This frees a GPIO completely and signals device presence constantly. 
3. Comment out `USB_DPU` and tie it to a GPIO of your choice - even on a different port. You have to signal device presence in your own user-code though.

Even with the pull-up tied to 3V3 you can trigger a USB re-enumeration by pulsing D- low in user-code. Add the otherwise optional 33/47 ohm inline resistors on D+/D- if you plan on doing this!

See [bootloader](bootloader) for additional considerations on the pin configuration if you plan to use the USB bootloader!

> [!NOTE]
> Use `make clean` before `make` whenever you change the configuration in `usb_config.h`


### It's got demos!

Here are the following demos and their statuses...

| Example      | Description | ‚ùñ | üêß |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| [demo_gamepad](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/tree/master/demo_gamepad) | Extremely simple example, 2-axis gamepad + 8 buttons | `‚úÖ` | `‚úÖ` |
| [demo_composite_hid](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/tree/master/demo_composite_hid) | Mouse and Keyboard in one device | `‚úÖ` | `‚úÖ` |
| [demo_hidapi](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/tree/master/demo_hidapi) | Write code to directly talk to your project with fully-formed messages. (Works on [Android](https://github.com/cnlohr/androidusbtest)) | `‚úÖ` | `‚úÖ` |
| [bootloader](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/tree/master/bootloader) | CH32V003 Self-bootloader, able to flash itself with minichlink | `‚úÖ` | `‚úÖ` |

And the following largely incomplete, but proof-of-concept projects:

| Example      | Description | ‚ùñ | üêß |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| [cdc_exp](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/tree/master/testing/cdc_exp) | Enumerate as a USB Serial port and send and receive Data (incomplete, very simple) | `‚ö†Ô∏è` | `‚úÖ` | :question: |
| [demo_midi](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/tree/master/testing/demo_midi) | MIDI-IN and MIDI-OUT | `‚úÖ` | `‚úÖ` |
| [test_ethernet](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb/tree/master/testing/test_ethernet) | RNDIS Device (note: VERY SLOW) | `‚ö†Ô∏è` | `‚úÖ` |

Note: CDC In windows likely CAN work, but I can't figure out how to do it.  Linux explicitly blacklists all low-speed USB Ethernet that I could find.  The MIDI example only demonstrates MIDI-OUT.

### It's built on ch32v003fun

[ch32v003fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) is a minimal development SDK of sorts for the CH32V003, allowing for maximum flexability without needing lots of code surrounding a HAL.

## General developer notes

### Care surrounding interrupts and critical sections.

You are allowed to use interrupts and have critical sections, however, you should keep critical sections to approximately 40 or fewer cycles if possible.  Additionally if you are going to be using interrupts that will take longer than about 40 cycles to execute, you must enable preemption on that interrup.  For an example of how that works you can check the ws2812b SPI DMA driver in ch32v003fun.  The external pin-chane-interrupt **must** be the highest priority. And it **must never** be preempted.  While it's OK to have a short delay before it is fired, interrupting the USB reception code mid-transfer is prohibited.

### Modifying headers / `usb_config.h`

Note that if you change the pin assignments for your custom hardware in `usb_config.h`, you will need to run `make clean` afterwards (and then run `make`).

## It's still in beta.

This project is not ready for prime time, though it is sort of in a beta phase.  Proof of concept works, lots of demos work.  Maybe you can help out!
